        of calories.Bananas are one of the most widely consumed fruits in the

    <string name="beefstew">Beef stew is the benevolent king of all stews.
        Familiar yet never tiresome, chunks of tender beef and potatoes in rich
        brown gravy will always bring comfort and joy to our tables. Little things
        are what elevate a good stew to become a great one. Taking time to sear
        the beef is integral to flavor in both the meat and the gravy, as is
        letting it simmer low and slow until the beef is spoon-tender.
        Busy cooks might be tempted to purchase packages of so-called stew meat
        at the market, but it pays to follow this recipe and take a few minutes
        to cut up an economical chuck roast. Stew meat is a mixture of scraps
        left over when a butcher trims a range of cuts to go in the meat case,
        and these random pieces wonâ€™t cook the same way or finish at the same time
        . The uniformity of a well-marbled chuck roast yields consistent results
        and the best flavor. Originally, this recipe called for the stew to be
        cooked in a wok, which was trendy at the time. We prefer using a Dutch
        oven because it provides a large, flat surface to properly brown the meat.</string>

        very expensive.But due to the urge to eat some, ill help you make 
        it better. At least solve some health complications caused by beef meat.
        Beef meat should not be roasted or pan fried. Trust me, it,s almost equal
        to eating it raw. Boiling, wet frying, oven cooking, grinding, etc are
        among the best methods of cooking beef</string>
    <string name="friedchicken">Fried chicken  is a dish consisting of chicken pieces
        usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then
        pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating
        or crust to the exterior of the chicken. What separates fried chicken from
        other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints,
        and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered
        of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken. </string>
    <string name="stewedbeef">Beef sold for stew (that is, trimmed and cut into
        bite-size cubes) is generally chuck or roundâ€”tough cuts that become
        tender and flavorful when slowly simmered in liquid. Beef round cuts
        (bottom and eye) are generally leaner than chuck (shoulder, leg and butt)
        and very well-suited to stew.</string>
    <string name="pilau"> pilau is a dish, originating from the Indian subcontinent,
        in which rice is cooked in a seasoned broth. In some cases, the rice may
        attain its brown or golden color by first being sauteed lightly in oil
        before the addition of broth. Cooked onion, garlic cloves, sliced carrot,
        other vegetables, as well as a mix of spices, may be added. Depending on
        the local cuisine, it may additionally contain meat, fish, vegetables,
        pasta (orzo), or dried fruit.</string>

        of food, usually vegetables. However, different varieties of salad may
        contain virtually any type of ready-to-eat food. Salads are typically
        served at room temperature or chilled.Garden salads use a base of leafy greens
        such as lettuce, arugula/rocket, kale or spinach; they are common enough
        that the word salad alone often refers specifically to garden salads</string>
